DESCRIPTION:
    Update the internal IMDB movie database. First, download the three requisite
    files: "name.basics.tsv.gz", "title.basics.tsv.gz", "title.crew.tsv.gz". After
    downloading the files, moviecat will enter update mode and load all of the
    included data into the internal database. Any movies in the current database
    not in the updated database are kept, otherwise the data is updated to
    reflect the newly downloaded files.
