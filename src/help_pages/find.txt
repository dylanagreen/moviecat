DESCRIPTION:
    Attempt to find MOVIE in the internal IMDB database. If the movie is found,
    print a paragraph of information.

    If disambiguation is enabled, a second window will open requesting further
    details. This window could have up to three options:

    NAME - DESCRIPTION
    ------------------
    year - the year the movie was released
    director - (one of) the director(s) of the movie
    writer - (one of) the writer(s) of the movie

    To use these options, pass the [NAME] followed by the value. For example:

    year 1985
    director robert zemeckis
    writer bob gale

    Note that these options are case insensitive.

    After disambiguation, print all MOVIEs matching the input criteria. To
    select a movie input the printed number identifier next to its name and year.
