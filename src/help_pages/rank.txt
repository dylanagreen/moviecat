NAME: rank
USAGE:
    rank [MOVIE]
DESCRIPTION:
    Rank a MOVIE relative to the other MOVIEs in the internal ranking. First
    attempt to find MOVIE in the internal IMDB database.

    If disambiguation is enabled, a second window will open requesting further
    details. This window could have up to three options:

    NAME - DESCRIPTION
    ------------------
    year - the year the movie was released
    director - (one of) the director(s) of the movie
    writer - (one of) the writer(s) of the movie

    To use these options, pass the [NAME] followed by the value. For example:

    year 1985
    director robert zemeckis
    writer bob gale

    Note that these options are case insensitive.

    After disambiguation all MOVIEs matching the input criteria will print. To
    select a movie input the printed number identifier next to its name and year.

    Once a MOVIE is selected, moviecat will ask a series of yes or no questions,
    comparing the input movie to a selection of movies already ranked in the database.
    Answer `yes` or `y` if the selected MOVIE is better than the reference movie,
    answer `no`, `n`, or anything else if it is not.

    NOTE: This means that the default response is `no`.

    After ranking the MOVIE, optionally enter the date on which the MOVIE was
    watched. This step can be skipped by entering `n` or `N`.

    Finally, the MOVIE's final rank is printed, and the movie is inserted into
    the ranking database for future reference.
