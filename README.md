# moviecat
Lightweight intelligent desktop movie ranking program!

Moviecat uses a binary search version of insertion sort to insert movies into your
personal movie list. The program will ask you a series of direct comparison questions
where you must compare the movie to another movie in your personal list. After
a set amount of questions the program will insert that movie into the found position
in your movie list.

This program will organically build a ranking of every movie you've seen without
the requirement for scales. You are freed from having to rate movies on arbitrary
scales, like 0-10, or out of 5 stars, or the number of times you'd rather watch
Casablanca as compared to each movie. Things like that.
